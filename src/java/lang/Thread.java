/**
 * A <i>thread</i> is a thread of execution in a program. The Java
 * Virtual Machine allows an application to have multiple threads of
 * execution running concurrently.
 * <p>
 * Every thread has a priority. Threads with higher priority are
 * executed in preference to threads with lower priority. Each thread
 * may or may not also be marked as a daemon. When code running in
 * some thread creates a new <code>Thread</code> object, the new
 * thread has its priority initially set equal to the priority of the
 * creating thread, and is a daemon thread if and only if the
 * creating thread is a daemon.
 * <p>
 * When a Java Virtual Machine starts up, there is usually a single
 * non-daemon thread (which typically calls the method named
 * <code>main</code> of some designated class). The Java Virtual
 * Machine continues to execute threads until either of the following
 * occurs:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The <code>exit</code> method of class <code>Runtime</code> has been
 *     called and the security manager has permitted the exit operation
 *     to take place.
 * <li>All threads that are not daemon threads have died, either by
 *     returning from the call to the <code>run</code> method or by
 *     throwing an exception that propagates beyond the <code>run</code>
 *     method.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * There are two ways to create a new thread of execution. One is to
 * declare a class to be a subclass of <code>Thread</code>. This
 * subclass should override the <code>run</code> method of class
 * <code>Thread</code>. An instance of the subclass can then be
 * allocated and started. For example, a thread that computes primes
 * larger than a stated value could be written as follows:
 * <hr><blockquote><pre>
 *     class PrimeThread extends Thread {
 *         long minPrime;
 *         PrimeThread(long minPrime) {
 *             this.minPrime = minPrime;
 *         }
 *
 *         public void run() {
 *             // compute primes larger than minPrime
 *             &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
 *         }
 *     }
 * </pre></blockquote><hr>
 * <p>
 * The following code would then create a thread and start it running:
 * <blockquote><pre>
 *     PrimeThread p = new PrimeThread(143);
 *     p.start();
 * </pre></blockquote>
 * <p>
 * The other way to create a thread is to declare a class that
 * implements the <code>Runnable</code> interface. That class then
 * implements the <code>run</code> method. An instance of the class can
 * then be allocated, passed as an argument when creating
 * <code>Thread</code>, and started. The same example in this other
 * style looks like the following:
 * <hr><blockquote><pre>
 *     class PrimeRun implements Runnable {
 *         long minPrime;
 *         PrimeRun(long minPrime) {
 *             this.minPrime = minPrime;
 *         }
 *
 *         public void run() {
 *             // compute primes larger than minPrime
 *             &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
 *         }
 *     }
 * </pre></blockquote><hr>
 * <p>
 * The following code would then create a thread and start it running:
 * <blockquote><pre>
 *     PrimeRun p = new PrimeRun(143);
 *     new Thread(p).start();
 * </pre></blockquote>
 * <p>
 * Every thread has a name for identification purposes. More than
 * one thread may have the same name. If a name is not specified when
 * a thread is created, a new name is generated for it.
 * <p>
 * Unless otherwise noted, passing a {@code null} argument to a constructor
 * or method in this class will cause a {@link NullPointerException} to be
 * thrown.

     * the specified <i>stack size</i>.
     *
     * <p>This constructor is identical to {@link
     * #Thread(ThreadGroup,Runnable,String)} with the exception of the fact
     * that it allows the thread stack size to be specified.  The stack size
     * is the approximate number of bytes of address space that the virtual
     * machine is to allocate for this thread's stack.  <b>The effect of the
     * {@code stackSize} parameter, if any, is highly platform dependent.</b>
     *
     * <p>On some platforms, specifying a higher value for the
     * {@code stackSize} parameter may allow a thread to achieve greater
     * recursion depth before throwing a {@link StackOverflowError}.
     * Similarly, specifying a lower value may allow a greater number of
     * threads to exist concurrently without throwing an {@link
     * OutOfMemoryError} (or other internal error).  The details of
     * the relationship between the value of the <tt>stackSize</tt> parameter
     * and the maximum recursion depth and concurrency level are
     * platform-dependent.  <b>On some platforms, the value of the
     * {@code stackSize} parameter may have no effect whatsoever.</b>
     *
     * <p>The virtual machine is free to treat the {@code stackSize}
     * parameter as a suggestion.  If the specified value is unreasonably low
     * for the platform, the virtual machine may instead use some
     * platform-specific minimum value; if the specified value is unreasonably
     * high, the virtual machine may instead use some platform-specific
     * maximum.  Likewise, the virtual machine is free to round the specified
     * value up or down as it sees fit (or to ignore it completely).
     *
     * <p>Specifying a value of zero for the {@code stackSize} parameter will
     * cause this constructor to behave exactly like the
     * {@code Thread(ThreadGroup, Runnable, String)} constructor.
     *
     * <p><i>Due to the platform-dependent nature of the behavior of this
     * constructor, extreme care should be exercised in its use.
     * The thread stack size necessary to perform a given computation will
     * likely vary from one JRE implementation to another.  In light of this
     * variation, careful tuning of the stack size parameter may be required,
     * and the tuning may need to be repeated for each JRE implementation on
     * which an application is to run.</i>

     * document their implementation's behavior with respect to the
     * {@code stackSize} parameter.

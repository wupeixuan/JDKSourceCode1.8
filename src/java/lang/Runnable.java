/**
 * The <code>Runnable</code> interface should be implemented by any
 * class whose instances are intended to be executed by a thread. The
 * class must define a method of no arguments called <code>run</code>.
 * <p>
 * This interface is designed to provide a common protocol for objects that
 * wish to execute code while they are active. For example,
 * <code>Runnable</code> is implemented by class <code>Thread</code>.
 * Being active simply means that a thread has been started and has not
 * yet been stopped.
 * <p>
 * In addition, <code>Runnable</code> provides the means for a class to be
 * active while not subclassing <code>Thread</code>. A class that implements
 * <code>Runnable</code> can run without subclassing <code>Thread</code>
 * by instantiating a <code>Thread</code> instance and passing itself in
 * as the target.  In most cases, the <code>Runnable</code> interface should
 * be used if you are only planning to override the <code>run()</code>
 * method and no other <code>Thread</code> methods.
 * This is important because classes should not be subclassed
 * unless the programmer intends on modifying or enhancing the fundamental
 * behavior of the class.

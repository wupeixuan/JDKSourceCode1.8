/**
 * A cancellable asynchronous computation.  This class provides a base
 * implementation of {@link Future}, with methods to start and cancel
 * a computation, query to see if the computation is complete, and
 * retrieve the result of the computation.  The result can only be
 * retrieved when the computation has completed; the {@code get}
 * methods will block if the computation has not yet completed.  Once
 * the computation has completed, the computation cannot be restarted
 * or cancelled (unless the computation is invoked using
 * {@link #runAndReset}).
 *
 * <p>A {@code FutureTask} can be used to wrap a {@link Callable} or
 * {@link Runnable} object.  Because {@code FutureTask} implements
 * {@code Runnable}, a {@code FutureTask} can be submitted to an
 * {@link Executor} for execution.
 *
 * <p>In addition to serving as a standalone class, this class provides
 * {@code protected} functionality that may be useful when creating
 * customized task classes.

     * on a "state" field updated via CAS to track completion, along
     * with a simple Treiber stack to hold waiting threads.
